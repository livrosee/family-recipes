        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>1 large egg</li>
                <li>1/2 tablespoon of unsalted butter</li>
                <li>1 slice of bread, any kind</li>
                <li>table salt</li>
                <li>ground black pepper</li>
            </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Using a biscuit cutter, cut a circular hole into the center of a slice of bread.</li>
                <li>Heat a skillet or frying pan at low heat. Place the 1/2 tablespoon of unsalted butter onto the pan and let melt.</li>
                <li>Once butter has melted, place the slice of bread into the pan and crack the egg directly into the hole.</li>
                <li>Sprinkle salt and pepper onto the egg.</li>
                <li>After a minute or two, the egg white should no longer be transparent. Once the egg reaches this point, 
                    flip the bead and egg over with a spatula. The egg should remain stuck to the edges of the bead with 
                    careful handling.</li>
                <li>Sprinkle salt and pepper onto the egg. After 30 to 40 seconds, turn off the flame and serve!</li>
            </ol>
